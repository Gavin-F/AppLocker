nwHacks - Applocker

Applocker is an android application that allows users to lock their mobile apps of their choice such as Facebook, Instagram, games, etc. 
The main use for our app is when you need to increase your productivity by removing distractions from your work environment.
Our app will prevent you from getting distracted from your work by making the process of opening distracting apps much more difficult.
